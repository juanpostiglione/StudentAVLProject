# Project Description
This project is about designing and implementing a custom AVL tree to efficiently manage UF student accounts, uniquely identified by their GatorIDs. The core focus of the project lies in the development and integration of various methods pivotal to the functionality of an AVL tree data structure. These include:

## Insertion: Efficiently adding new student accounts while maintaining the AVL tree's balanced nature.
## Deletion: Removing student accounts and rebalancing the tree as necessary to preserve its AVL properties.
## Search: Implementing a robust search mechanism to quickly find student accounts using their GatorIDs.
## Traversals: Facilitating various tree traversal methods (inorder, preorder, postorder) to navigate through the student accounts.

The project encompasses the following key responsibilities:

## Designing the AVL Tree Structure: Crafting an intuitive and functional interface, alongside the necessary modules and functions, that encapsulate all standard operations of an AVL tree.
## Input Parsing and Command Validation: Ensuring accurate parsing of input data and validating commands to interact with the AVL tree, thereby guaranteeing the integrity and correctness of operations performed on the tree.
## Building the Main Function: Developing the main driver function of the project, which involves parsing user inputs and invoking the corresponding AVL tree functions. This main function acts as the central hub for matching user commands with their respective outputs.
## Code Testing: Rigorously testing the code within set constraints to ensure robustness, efficiency, and reliability in managing student accounts through the AVL tree structure.
This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of AVL tree data structures, emphasizing practical application in managing complex datasets with efficiency and accuracy.
